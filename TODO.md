# HEALPix Viewer TODO

### Current Status (Build 002)

- `File Open` is implemented
- saving textures as PNG is implemented
- compositing textures for proper `Export To` is in the works
- Drag and Drop support is implemented (needs more testing)...

### Public Release Blocking

- partial sky (`INDXSCHM = 'EXPLICIT'`) HEALPix file support
- data analysis features (functional map transforms, equalization, etc.)

### Planned Features

- better automatic range finder (max entropy, limit statistics?)
- line convolution for polarization and vector maps
- arithmetic operations on loaded map data (ala fcalc)

### Bug Fixes

- currently clean
